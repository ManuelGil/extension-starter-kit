## Prerequisites

You need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system to run the examples. It is recommended to use the node version used for VS Code development itself which is documented [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#prerequisites)

## Getting Started

To get started with the extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone
    cd extension-starter-kit
    npm install
    code .
    ```

2. Press `F5` to open a new instance of Visual Studio Code with the extension running in debug mode
3. Open the command palette and run the `My Extension: Hello World` command
4. The extension will display a message in the output window

For more information, see the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)

## Customization

To customize the extension, follow these steps:

1. Update multiple instances of the following items in bulk:

    - `extensionIdentifier` - Replace with your extension identifier, e.g. `fileManager`
    - `extension-starter-kit` - Replace with your extension name, e.g. `vscode-file-manager`
    - `My Extension` - Replace with your extension display name, e.g. `VS Code File Manager`
    - `githubUsername` - Replace with your GitHub githubUsername, e.g. `ManuelGil`
    - `extensionPublisher` - Replace with your extension publisher, e.g. `imgildev`

2. Change the `LICENSE` file with your extension information
3. Remove the unnecessary files and folders
4. Add the necessary files and folders
5. Update the `src/app/configs/constants.config.ts` and `src/app/configs/extension.config.ts` file with your extension information
6. Update the `src/app/controllers/feedback.controller.ts` file with your extension information
7. Update the `src/extension.ts` file with your extension information
8. Update the `settings.schema.json` file with your extension information
9. Update the `package.json` file with your extension information
10. Update the `README.md` file with your extension information

For more information, see the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)

## Running the documentation

To run the documentation, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm run compodoc
```

This will generate the documentation in the `compodoc` folder.

For more information, see the [official documentation](https://compodoc.app/guides/getting-started.html)

## Building the extension

To build the extension, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
vsce package
```

This will create a `.vsix` file in the root of the project.

For more information, see the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension)

## Publishing the extension

To publish the extension, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
vsce publish
```

This will open a new instance of Visual Studio Code with the extension running in debug mode.

For more information, see the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)
